Graphing calculator written using SFML 2.5.1 for my object oriented C++ final. Implements the shunting yard algorithm, a reverse polish notation evaluator, and an input tokenizer that accepts an equation as a string and tokenizes it for shunting yard

Modify build_example.py with the SFML include path to build with g++, might also work with clang if you tweak the script a bit

# Usage
