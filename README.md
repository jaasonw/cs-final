Graphing calculator written using SFML 2.5.1 for my fundamentals of computer science II c++ final. Implements an input tokenizer that tokenizes an equation into tokens, the shunting yard algorithm to convert them to reverse polish notation, and an evaluator for reverse polish notation.

Modify build_example.py with the SFML include path to build with g++, should also work with clang but not thoroughly tested.
