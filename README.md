Graphing calculator written using SFML 2.5.1. Implements an input tokenizer, uses the shunting yard algorithm to convert them to reverse polish notation, and an rpn evaluator.

Modify build_example.py with the SFML include path to build with g++, should also work with clang but not thoroughly tested.
